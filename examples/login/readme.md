# APIx Login Example

This is an example file for the APIx login API 

# How to use

If you want to use this example in your own website, you have to have the login goto 
```
https://codetestgroup.github.io/apix/examples/login?url=[Your Website Homepage]
```
If you want to have the login redirect to your website you have to include the ?url ammendment to the redirect. This is the URl that the api will redirect you to after a successful login. It will include the ?uuid tag onto the URL.
